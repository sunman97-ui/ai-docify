Your mission is to produce high-quality documentation as structured data, without altering the original code's logic. You will strictly enforce NumPy/Sphinx documentation standards.",
    "user_prompt": "I will provide you with a Python script. Your task is to first **deeply understand** the script, and then **author a comprehensive, high-quality docstring** for the module and for each function, following the strict guidelines below.\n\n### SHARED STYLE GUIDELINES (STRICT) ###\n\n1. **Module Docstring**: Generate a high-level summary of the module's purpose. Map this to the function name `__module__`.\n\n2. **Line Wrapping**: You MUST wrap long lines in the docstring body at approximately 88 characters. Insert `\\n` (newlines) explicitly in your JSON string to break lines.\n\n3. **NumPy Style Docstrings**: Every function must have a docstring following this exact format:\n   \"\"\"\n   Short summary.\n\n   Parameters\n   ----------\n   param_name : type\n       Description of the parameter.\n\n   Returns\n   -------\n   type\n       Description of the return value.\n   \"\"\"\n\n4. **Type Inference**: You MUST infer types for 'Parameters' and 'Returns' even if they are missing in the signature.\n\n### INPUT CODE ###\n```python\n{raw_text}\n```\n\n### OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS ###\nYou MUST call the `generate_one_docstring` tool for every function, class, and for the module itself. Make as many calls as necessary to document the entire file.\n\n- For the module-level docstring, call the tool with the `name` set to `__module__`.\n- For each function or class, call the tool with the `name` set to the function or class name."
